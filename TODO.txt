short term goals :

    - remove node (OK)
    - move node
    - display vertex (create vertex and show them) (OK)
    - clear function so that I don't have to refreh the page each time i want a new drawing.
    - remove Node also remove all vertexes linked to this node (OK);
    - delete a graph (ok)

    - only dispay the current graph (OK)
    - render graphs that are given by matrix representation.

    - pop up that shows node value when hovered.

    - value of BFS node is he distance between the root node (and implement a root node version)

    - JSDOC !!!!!


middle term goals :
    - organize the code better.
    - implement usual graph algorihtms.(DFS , BFS ,H-cycle , etc )


long term goals :

    • optimize the display 
    • shortcut
    • undo-redo
