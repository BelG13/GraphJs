# GraphJS

GraphJs is a visual framework for graph theory.
the purpose of this project is to help students to understand graph theory by using intuitive visual tools.

* **Draw** nodes and vertexes using **p5.js**
* Allow students to compute some basic Graph theory algorihtm such as : **deep first search** , **Breadth first search** , etc

## Current state of GraphJS

The framework is still at its beginning , it allows users to create graphs , add nodes to them and connect nodes using vertexes.
Some basic graph theory algorithms are usable : **Deep first Search** and **Breadth first search**.

Missing basic features : 

    • Multi-vertexes for 2 given nodes is not implemented yet.
    
    • Vertexes don't have any value.
    
    • Vertexes are not directed.
    
    • Allow removing vertexes by cliking on it.
    
    • Vertex from a node to the same node.

## Start using GraphJS

* Download the repository from github
* Start **server.py** using the command **node server.js**
* Open your navigator on **localhost:3000**

At this point you should see this :
